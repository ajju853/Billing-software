# Billing-software
This Python-based billing software uses Tkinter for its GUI. It manages sales for a retail store, handling medical supplies, groceries, and drinks. Users can input customer details, select products, and generate bills with automatic tax calculations. The app saves bills as text files and allows retrieval of past transactions.
